Vida's style reflects her past of growing up in upper class suburban Pennsylvania. One of their fellow New York City contestants, Chi-Chi Rodriguez, is a straight-talking, but naive and inexperienced drag queen. Seeing that Chi-Chi needs some drag queen confidence (despite her bravada), Vida and a reluctant Noxeema decide to cash in their plane tickets and buy an older model Cadillac convertible and drive to Hollywood with Chi-Chi. Their drive takes them through much of the country where alternate lifestyles are less tolerated than they may be in New York City or Los Angeles. The three have an extended stay in small town Snydersville, where their car breaks down. If they ever make it out of Snydersville, they may be the better for their stay by learning more about themselves while dealing with the issues of town residents and spending more time together.

Clarice is able to figure out the assignment is to pick Lecter's brains to help them solve another serial murder case, that of someone coined by the media as Buffalo Bill, who has so far killed five victims, all located in the eastern US, all young women who are slightly overweight (especially around the hips), all who were drowned in natural bodies of water, and all who were stripped of large swaths of skin.

She has to decide how much she will play along, as his request in return for talking to him is to expose herself emotionally to him. The case takes a more dire turn when a sixth victim is discovered, this one from who they are able to retrieve a key piece of evidence, if Lecter is being forthright as to its meaning. A potential seventh victim is high profile Catherine Martin, the daughter of Senator Ruth Martin, which places greater scrutiny on the case as they search for a hopefully still alive Catherine.

Wanda further plans to triple cross Otto by eliminating him from the picture after she has the jewels. They are able to get George arrested with him not knowing who tipped the police off, in the process George being implicated by an elderly eyewitness named Eileen Coady. With George in jail, Wanda and Otto discover that he in turn has protected his investment by moving the jewels from their agreed to hiding location, he not telling anyone except Ken some hint of where they are. Ken, an animal lover with an extreme stuttering problem, is given a task by George: kill Mrs. Coady before she is able to testify against him, as she is the crown's primary witness. Meanwhile, Wanda has a plan of her own to reach her end goal: seduce George's defense lawyer, Archie Leach, in finding out any and all of George's secrets concerning the heist, including the location of the jewels. Archie may be easy prey for Wanda's seduction as Archie's wife is a self-absorbed woman who pays Archie little attention. Otto may throw a wrench into Wanda's plans if he finds out what she's doing only feeling that she being solely his lover trumps all else.::Huggo", "movie_avg_rating": 3.785425101214575, "movie_year": 1988, "movie_title": "Fish Called Wanda, A", "movie_genres": ["Comedy"], "movie_director": "Charles Crichton", "movie_cast": ["John Cleese", "Jamie Lee Curtis", "Kevin Kline", "Michael Palin", "Maria Aitken", "Tom Georgeson", "Patricia Hayes", "Geoffrey Palmer", "Cynthia Cleese", "Mark Elwes", "Neville Phillips", "Peter Jonfield", "Ken Campbell", "Al Ashton", "Roger Hume", "Roger Brierley", "Llewellyn Rees", "Michael Percival", "Kate Lansbury", "Robert Ian Mackenzie", "Andrew MacLachlan", "Roland MacLeod", "Jeremy Child", "Pamela Miles", "Tom Pigott Smith", "Katherine John", "Sophie Johnstone", "Kim Barclay", "Sharon Marino", "Patrick Newman", "David Simeon", "Imogen Bickford-Smith", "Tia Lee", "Robert Putt", "Waydon Croft", "John Dixon", "Anthony Pedley", "Robert McBain", "Clare McIntyre", "Charu Bala Chokshi", "Stephen Fry", "John Bird", "Chris Chering", "Terence Conoley", "Robert Goodman", "Rebecca Moore", "Mike Reynell", "Peter Roy", "Guy Standeven"]}, {"movie_plot": "The story of Brian of Nazareth, born on the same day as Jesus of Nazareth, who takes a different path in life that leads to the same conclusion.

A former clown applies for the job and the butcher's intent is to have him work for a little while and then serve him to quirky tenants who pay the butcher in, of course, grain. The clown and butcher's daughter fall in love and she tries to foil her father's plans by contacting the \"troglodytes\", a grain eating sub-group of society who live entirely underground. The \"trogs\" are possibly the most sensible of the lot, as they see food as food and not money.::Anonymous", "movie_avg_rating": 3.876923076923077, "movie_year": 1991, "movie_title": "Delicatessen", "movie_genres": ["Comedy", "Sci-Fi"], "movie_director": "Marc Caro", "movie_cast": ["Pascal Benezech", "Dominique Pinon", "Marie-Laure Dougnac", "Jean-Claude Dreyfus", "Karin Viard", "Ticky Holgado", "Anne-Marie Pisani", "Boban Janevski", "Mikael Todde", "Edith Ker", "Rufus", "Jacques Mathou", "Howard Vernon", "Chick Ortega", "Silvie Laguna", "Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Perrier", "Dominique Zardi", "Patrick Paroux", "Maurice Lamy", "Marc Caro", "Eric Averlant", "Dominique Bettenfeld", "Jean-Luc Caron", "Bernard Flavien", "David Defever", "Raymond Forestier", "Robert Baud", "Clara"]}, {"movie_plot": "Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia and Chewbacca face attack by the Imperial forces and its AT-AT walkers on the ice planet Hoth.

The grandson is sure he won't like the story, with a romance at its core, he preferring something with lots of action and \"no kissing\". But the grandson is powerless to stop his grandfather, whose feelings he doesn't want to hurt. The story centers on Buttercup, a former farm girl who has been chosen as the princess bride to Prince Humperdinck of Florian. Buttercup does not love him, she who still laments the death of her one true love, Westley, five years ago. Westley was a hired hand on the farm, his stock answer of \"as you wish\" to any request she made of him which she came to understand was his way of saying that he loved her. But Westley went away to sea, only to be killed by the Dread Pirate Roberts. On a horse ride to clear her mind of her upcoming predicament of marriage, Buttercup is kidnapped by a band of bandits: Vizzini who works on his wits, and his two associates, a giant named Fezzik who works on his brawn, and a Spaniard named Inigo Montoya, who has trained himself his entire life to be an expert swordsman. They in turn are chased by the Dread Pirate Roberts himself. But chasing them all is the Prince, and his men led by Count Tyrone Rugen. What happens to these collectives is dependent partly on Buttercup, who does not want to marry the Prince, and may see other options as lesser evils, and partly on the other motives of individuals within the groups. But a larger question is what the grandson will think of the story as it proceeds and at its end, especially as he sees justice as high a priority as action.::Huggo", "movie_avg_rating": 4.172839506172839, "movie_year": 1987, "movie_title": "Princess Bride, The", "movie_genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Comedy", "Romance"], "movie_director": "Rob Reiner", "movie_cast": ["Cary Elwes", "Mandy Patinkin", "Chris Sarandon", "Christopher Guest", "Wallace Shawn", "Andr\u00e9 the Giant", "Fred Savage", "Robin Wright", "Peter Falk", "Peter Cook", "Mel Smith", "Carol Kane", "Billy Crystal", "Anne Dyson", "Margery Mason", "Malcolm Storry", "Willoughby Gray", "Betsy Brantley", "Paul Badger", "Errol Bennett", "Danny Blackner", "Willy DeVille", "Mickey Feat", "Guy Fletcher", "Mark Knopfler", "Jamie Lane", "Sallie McLaughlin", "Derek Pykett"]}, {"movie_plot": "The year is 1936.

While taking the el train home every night, he notices the same young, beautiful contemplative woman staring out of one of the windows of Miss Mitzi's Dance Studio, which specializes in ballroom. He is intrigued enough with her beauty and sadness to go in one evening on his way home. He learns that she is Paulina, one of the instructors and a former world class ballroom dancer. Because of her, he signs up for beginner group dance lessons, regardless of them being taught by Miss Mitzi herself, and not Paulina. As time progresses, John gets caught up in the lives of those at Miss Mitzi's: his two fellow classmates - overweight Vern who wants to learn to dance for his upcoming wedding, and Chic, who wants to impress the ladies - and two of the studio's competitive amateurs, opinionated and brash Bobbie, who is looking for a dance partner, and one person who surprises John and who just wants to be able to show his true colors to the world while hiding under a mask. But as Paulina slowly allows herself to be involved in their lives as well, despite she vowing not to fraternize with the students, John comes to the spoken realization of what he was looking for when he first spotted Paulina in the window. Similarly, each of those at the dance studio are looking for their small place in life with the right person, Paulina included. John may not get the happy ending that he wants as Beverly, based on circumstances, believes he is having an affair.::Huggo", "movie_avg_rating": 4.260869565217392, "movie_year": 1996, "movie_title": "Shall We Dance?", "movie_genres": ["Comedy"], "movie_director": "Peter Chelsom", "movie_cast": ["Richard Gere", "Jennifer Lopez", "Susan Sarandon", "Lisa Ann Walter", "Stanley Tucci", "Anita Gillette", "Bobby Cannavale", "Omar Benson Miller", "Tamara Hope", "Stark Sands", "Richard Jenkins", "Nick Cannon", "Sarah Lafleur", "Onalee Ames", "Diana Salvatore", "Daphne Korol", "Driton 'Tony' Dovolani", "Katya Virshilas", "David Sparrow", "Matt Gordon", "Candace Smith", "Sandra Caldwell", "Mairi Babb", "Ann Margaret Clements", "Karina Smirnoff", "Diana Marquis", "Beatriz Pizano", "Deborah Yates", "Mya", "Holly Johnson", "Gio Tropea", "James Sermons", "Barre W.

Almost immediately after Tonya is found and rushed to a hospital, Pete and Billy Ray are found at a roadside bar, where they had been bragging about what they did to Tonya. Tonya's understandably distraught and enraged father, Carl Lee Hailey, remembers a case from a year ago, when four white men raped an African-American girl in a nearby town, and got acquitted. Carl is determined to not let that happen in this case. While deputy Dwayne Powell Looney is escorting Pete and Billy Ray up a flight of stairs to a court room, Carl emerges from the building's basement with an assault rifle, and he kills Pete and Billy Ray for what they did to Tonya. Carl is later arrested at his house by African-American sheriff Ozzie Walls, and Carl is scheduled to be placed on trial. Despite the efforts of the NAACP and local African-American leaders to persuade Carl to choose some of their high-powered attorneys, Carl wants to be represented by his friend Jake Tyler Brigance, who has a wife named Carla and a daughter named Hannah. Presiding over the trial is white judge Omar Noose, and the prosecution attorney is Rufus Buckley, who would like nothing more than to win the case and swim in the publicity that a win would generate, because Rufus realizes that a murder conviction could help him gain higher office. Helping Jake on the case are his former law professor Lucien Wilbanks, fellow attorney Harry Rex Vonner, and law student Ellen Roark. Ellen has had experience with death penalty cases, and that's exactly what Rufus may be seeking. To start things off, Noose denies bail and denies Jake's petition for a change of venue. Carl has also been fired from his job. Billy Ray Cobb's brother Freddie Lee Cobb wants revenge on Carl, so Freddy gets the help of the Mississippi branch of the KKK, led by Mississippi grand dragon Stump Sisson. Carl's wife Gwen tells Carl that a doctor has said that because of Pete and Billy Ray, Tonya's reproductive organs are damaged enough to where she won't be able to have kids when she grows up. That night, a KKK member is found trying to plant a bomb under Jake's porch. Jake's secretary Ethel Twitty and her husband Bud are also attacked by the KKK. Still, Jake, Harry, Lucien, and Ellen continue to help Carl. On the day the trial begins, there is a riot outside the court building between the KKK and the area's African-American residents, and Stump Sisson is killed by a molotov cocktail that was dropped from a roof by one of Carl's sons, who was not seen dropping it. Freddy and the KKK start burning crosses throughout Canton, and one of the crosses burns Jake's house down while Jake and his family are not home. As a result, the National Guard is called to Canton to keep the peace during the trial. But Freddy is not about to let that stop him. While Freddy continues his efforts to get revenge on Carl for Billy Ray's death, Carl's attorneys put everything they've got into Carl's defense.::Todd Baldridge", "movie_avg_rating": 3.685344827586207, "movie_year": 1996, "movie_title": "Time to Kill, A", "movie_genres": ["Drama"], "movie_director": "Joel Schumacher", "movie_cast": ["Matthew McConaughey", "Sandra Bullock", "Samuel L.

She agrees to catch up to the rest of the unit after he dies. All the patient remembers is that he is English and that he is married. Their solitude is disrupted with the arrival at the church of fellow Canadian David Caravaggio, part of the Intelligence Service, who is certain that he knows the patient as a man who cooperated with the Germans. Caravaggio believes that the patient's memory is largely in tact and that he is running away from his past, in part or in its entirety. The patient does open up about his past, all surrounding his work as a cartographer in North Africa, which was interrupted by the war. He may not be running from his work as a spy for the Germans as Caravaggio believes, but rather the memory of an affair he had with married Katherine Clifton, the love of his life, and the memory of a promise not totally fulfilled. Hana may also test her theory of her fates with love and death as she embarks on a relationship of her own with Kip Singh, a Sikh from India, whose unit has camped on the now overgrown lawn of the church.

Cameron's high school English teacher Howard Brackett is overjoyed when Cameron wins the award and mentions Howard's contribution in his acting life. That joy turns to horror when Cameron mentions to the worldwide audience that Howard is gay, especially horrific to Howard as he is engaged to fellow teacher Emily Montgomery, a woman with self-esteem issues as she had battled weight issues most of her life before she lost seventy-five pounds for the wedding. Howard's life is totally disrupted as Hollywood media descends on Greenleaf in order to get Howard's story. The rest of Greenleaf also openly wonders if Howard is indeed gay, as he exhibits many stereotypical gay tendencies, such as being neat, and loving music, dancing, poetry and Barbra Streisand. His cause is not helped in that his and Emily's relationship has not yet been consummated. The one person not concerned is Emily, who trusts Howard. As Howard continues to deny being gay to his family, friends and colleagues, he begins to examine himself hypercritically if only because if others believe he's gay, there may be some merit to the claim, as well as because of an incident that occurs with Hollywood reporter Peter Malloy, who is doing a week-long piece on Howard leading up to his and Emily's wedding. But Cameron Drake may be able to provide some overall perspective to what is happening to Howard and the frenzy he has caused.::Huggo", "movie_avg_rating": 3.3043478260869565, "movie_year": 1997, "movie_title": "In & Out", "movie_genres": ["Comedy"], "movie_director": "Frank Oz", "movie_cast": ["Kevin Kline", "Joan Cusack", "Tom Selleck", "Matt Dillon", "Debbie Reynolds", "Wilford Brimley", "Bob Newhart", "Gregory Jbara", "Shalom Harlow", "Shawn Hatosy", "Zak Orth", "Lauren Ambrose", "Alexandra Holden", "Lewis J.

The old man proves to be a sensation and is quickly recruited to be the store Santa at the main Macy's outlet. While he is successful, Ms. Walker learns that he calls himself Kris Kringle and he claims to be the actual Santa Claus. Despite reassurances by Kringle's doctor that he is harmless, Doris still has misgivings, especially when she has cynically trained herself, and especially her daughter, Susan, to reject all notions of belief and fantasy. And yet, people, especially Susan, begin to notice there is something special about Kris and his determination to advance the true spirit of Christmas amidst the rampant commercialism around him and succeeding in improbable ways. When a raucous conflict with the store's cruelly incompetent psychologist erupts, Kris finds himself held at Bellevue where, in despair, he deliberately fails a mental examination to ensure his commitment. All seems lost until Doris' friend, Fred Gaily, reassures Kris of his worth and agrees to represent him in the fight to secure his release. To achieve that, Fred arranges a formal hearing in which he argues that Kris is sane because he is in fact Santa Claus. What ensues is a bizarre hearing in which people's beliefs are reexamined and put to the test, but even so, it's going to take a miracle for Kris to win.::Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com)", "movie_avg_rating": 3.722772277227723, "movie_year": 1994, "movie_title": "Miracle on 34th Street", "movie_genres": ["Drama"], "movie_director": "George Seaton", "movie_cast": ["Maureen O'Hara", "John Payne", "Edmund Gwenn", "Gene Lockhart", "Natalie Wood", "Porter Hall", "William Frawley", "Jerome Cowan", "Philip Tonge", "Jack Albertson", "Harry Antrim", "Lela Bliss", "Walden Boyle", "Kevin Burke", "Dorothy Christy", "Dick Cogan", "Jeff Corey", "Sheryl Deauville", "Mike Donovan", "Teddy Driver", "Mary Field", "William Forrest", "Jack Gargan", "Robert Gist", "Jane Green", "Alvin Greenman", "Alvin Hammer", "Theresa Harris", "Percy Helton", "Herbert Heyes", "Clark Howat", "Robert Hyatt", "Richard Irving", "Robert Karnes", "Fran Lee", "Marlene Lyden", "Robert Lynn", "Mae Marsh", "Ida McGuire", "Joseph McInerney", "Jean O'Donnell", "Anne O'Neal", "'Snub' Pollard", "Lorin Raker", "Bob Reeves", "Thelma Ritter", "Stephen Roberts", "Jeffrey Sayre", "James Seay", "Irene Shirley", "Patty Smith", "Ray Spiker", "Ann Staunton", "Brick Sullivan", "Anthony Sydes", "Guy Thomajan", "Basil Walker"]}, {"movie_plot": "Brayker is a man who carries the last of seven keys, special containers which held the blood of Christ and were scattered across the universe to prevent the forces of evil from taking over.

In Marian's words, the large size of the house is a \"waste\".

She even believes natural associated processes such as menstruation are a sin, about which she has refused to mention to Carrie. Mrs. White's beliefs were taken to that extreme largely because of her own failed marriage and her husband Ralph long ago having run off with another woman. The only adult authority figure who tries to help Carrie with her life is her phys ed teacher, Miss Collins, who is nonetheless warned not to get too close to go against how Mrs. White chooses to raise Carrie, Mrs. White whose beliefs are well known in the community. An impromptu event that happens among Carrie's phys ed classmates against her leads to her classmates being punished. One of those students, self absorbed Chris Hargensen, vows revenge against Carrie for that punishment, the method of the revenge associated to the phys ed class incident. Another student however, the popular Sue Snell, begins to feel sorry for Carrie. In wanting to help her get out of her shell, Sue asks her boyfriend, the equally popular Tommy Ross, to take Carrie to the senior prom instead of her. This move does not sit well with Mrs. White, who in her extreme view believes Carrie will fall prey to sin. All these competing issues lead to Carrie deciding on an impulse to use a newfound skill to free herself from the figurative chains that have long been placed around her, with tragic consequences.::Huggo", "movie_avg_rating": 3.5041322314049586, "movie_year": 1976, "movie_title": "Carrie", "movie_genres": ["Horror"], "movie_director": "Brian De Palma", "movie_cast": ["Sissy Spacek", "Piper Laurie", "Amy Irving", "William Katt", "John Travolta", "Nancy Allen", "Betty Buckley", "P.J.

In wanting just a little freedom, she seized upon a chance opportunity to escape from the royal palace where she was staying, albeit with no money in her pockets. Joe believes he can get an exclusive interview with her without she even knowing that he's a reporter or that he's interviewing her. As Joe accompanies \"Anya Smith\" - her name as she tells him in trying to hide her true identity - around Rome on her incognito day of freedom somewhat unaware that the secret service is searching for her, along for the ride is Joe's photographer friend, Irving Radovich, who Joe has tasked with clandestinely taking photographs of her, those photos to accompany the story.

Norma is demented and believes she will return to the cinema industry, and is protected and isolated from the world by Max, who was her director and husband in the past and still loves her. Norma proposes Joe to move to the mansion and help her in writing a screenplay for her comeback to the cinema, and the small-time writer becomes her lover and gigolo. When Joe falls in love for the young aspirant writer Betty Schaefer, Norma becomes jealous and completely insane and her madness leads to a tragic end.::Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil", "movie_avg_rating": 4.2, "movie_year": 1950, "movie_title": "Sunset Blvd.", "movie_genres": ["Film-Noir"], "movie_director": "Billy Wilder", "movie_cast": ["William Holden", "Gloria Swanson", "Erich von Stroheim", "Nancy Olson", "Fred Clark", "Lloyd Gough", "Jack Webb", "Franklyn Farnum", "Larry J.

The reason for her absence was among other things to get a Reno divorce, from, of all people, Walter, who admits he was a bad husband. Hildy divorced Walter largely because she wanted more of a home life, whereas Walter saw her more as a driven hard-boiled reporter than subservient homemaker. Hildy has also come to tell Walter that she is taking the afternoon train to Albany, where she will be getting married tomorrow to staid straight-laced insurance agent, Bruce Baldwin, with whose mother they will live, at least for the first year. Walter doesn't want to lose Hildy, either as a reporter or a wife, and if he does, doesn't believe Bruce is worthy of her. Walter does whatever he can at least to delay Hildy and Bruce's trip, long enough to persuade Hildy to stay for good. His plan includes doing whatever he can to place Bruce in a bad light, while dangling a big story under her nose, namely covering what the newspaper believes is the unfair imminent execution of convicted cop killer, Earl Williams. Hildy doesn't trust Walter in dealing with her and Bruce in an above board manner, but the lure of what potentially may become the biggest story in years, which includes true love, a bumbling sheriff and a corrupt mayor, the latter's actions largely in light of an upcoming election, may prove to be too much for Hildy to resist, especially if it ends up being an exclusive.

He just has to make sure a train's schedule meets the required sailing schedule which meets the required coach schedule and so on. As such, he takes up what ends up being the highly publicized \u00a320,000 wager from his fellow members at the London Reform Club to do so, losing the bet which would ruin him financially. Along for the ride is Fogg's new, loyal and devoted valet, the recently arrived Latin immigrant, Passepartout, who possesses unusual skills which could be major assets, but whose all consuming thoughts on the opposite sex could take away his focus from the task at hand. Although Fogg has accounted for certain transportation delays, he may not account for cultural peccadilloes he may encounter along the way which could also cause delays. He is also unaware of the true reason a man name Fix is following them, he who could also derail Fogg's task permanently. As Fogg and Passepartout proceed on their journey, they get into one misadventure after another.

David needs the $1 million endowment of wealthy dowager Mrs. Carleton Random to complete the project. Her lawyer, Alexander Peabody, will make the decision on her behalf, so David needs to get in his favor. However, whenever David tries to make a good impression on Peabody, the same young woman always seems to do something to make him look bad. She is the flighty heiress Susan Vance. The more David wants Susan to go away, the more Susan seems not to want or be able to. But David eventually learns that Alexander Peabody is her good friend, who she calls Boopy, and Susan's Aunt Elizabeth, with whom David has also made a bad impression without her knowing who he is, is Mrs. Carleton Random. However getting in Aunt Elizabeth and Boopy's good graces is not as easy as Susan smoothing the waters with them. Throw into the mix a tame pet leopard named Baby that Susan's brother Mark inexplicably sends her from Brazil, Aunt Elizabeth's big game hunting friend Major Horace Applegate, Aunt Elizabeth's pet terrier George who has a penchant for burying bones and other things, and a traveling circus passing through town and David may never be able to finish his project or make it to his wedding.

Moss, a mechanic to fix whatever cars they steal which is important especially for their getaways, and Buck Barrow, one of Clyde's older brothers. The only reluctant tag-along is Buck's nervous wife, Blanche Barrow, a preacher's daughter. The gang's life changes after the first fatal shot is fired. Following, their willingness to shoot to kill increases to protect themselves and their livelihood. Their notoriety precedes them, so much so that no matter what one's opinion is of them, most want to have some association to the Barrow gang, to help them, to be spoken in the same breath as them, or to capture and or kill them. Of the many people they encounter in their crime spree, the one who may have the most profound effect on their lives is Texas Ranger Frank Hamer, who is looking for a little retribution.::Huggo", "movie_avg_rating": 3.819672131147541, "movie_year": 1967, "movie_title": "Bonnie and Clyde", "movie_genres": ["Crime", "Drama"], "movie_director": "Arthur Penn", "movie_cast": ["Warren Beatty", "Faye Dunaway", "Michael J.

Blanche has also decided to take a break from teaching as she states the situation has frayed her nerves. Knowing nothing about Stanley or the Kowalskis' lives, Blanche is shocked to find that they live in a cramped and run down ground floor apartment - which she proceeds to beautify by putting shades over the open light bulbs to soften the lighting - and that Stanley is not the gentleman that she is used to in men. As such, Blanche and Stanley have an antagonistic relationship from the start. Blanche finds that Stanley's hyper-masculinity, which often displays itself in physical outbursts, is common, coarse and vulgar, being common which in turn is what attracted Stella to him. Beyond finding Blanche's delicate hoidy-toidy act as putting on airs, Stanley, a plant worker, believes she may really have sold Belle Reve and is withholding Stella's fair share of the proceeds from them. What further affects the relationship between the three is that Stella is in the early stage of pregnancy with her and Stanley's first child. Soon after her arrival at the Kowalskis, Blanche starts to date Mitch, one of Stanley's friends and coworkers who is a little softer around the edges than most of Stanley's friends. Mitch does not hide the fact that he is looking in general to get married because of a personal issue, he wanting Blanche ultimately to be his wife. Mitch is somewhat unaware that Blanche has somewhat controlled their courtship to put herself in the best possible light, both figuratively and literally. But in Stanley's quest to find out the truth about Belle Reve and Blanche's life in Auriol, the interrelationships between Stanley, Blanche, Stella and Mitch may be irrevocably affected, with any revelation about that life which may further destroy what's left of Blanche's already damaged mental state.::Huggo", "movie_avg_rating": 3.816326530612245, "movie_year": 1951, "movie_title": "Streetcar Named Desire, A", "movie_genres": ["Drama"], "movie_director": "Elia Kazan", "movie_cast": ["Vivien Leigh", "Marlon Brando", "Kim Hunter", "Karl Malden", "Rudy Bond", "Nick Dennis", "Peg Hillias", "Wright King", "Richard Garrick", "Ann Dere", "Edna Thomas", "Mickey Kuhn", "Mel Archer", "Dahn Ben Amotz", "Marietta Canty", "John George", "John Gonetos", "Chester Jones", "Lyle Latell", "Maxie Thrower", "Charles Wagenheim", "John B.

Gandhi realizes that the laws are biased against Indians and decides to start a non-violent protest campaign for the rights of all Indians in South Africa. After numerous arrests and the unwanted attention of the world, the government finally relents by recognizing rights for Indians, though not for the native blacks of South Africa. After this victory, Gandhi is invited back to India, where he is now considered something of a national hero. He is urged to take up the fight for India's independence from the British Empire. Gandhi agrees, and mounts a non-violent non-cooperation campaign of unprecedented scale, coordinating millions of Indians nationwide. There are some setbacks, such as violence against the protesters and Gandhi's occasional imprisonment. Nevertheless, the campaign generates great attention, and Britain faces intense public pressure. Too weak from World War II to continue enforcing its will in India, Britain finally grants India's independence. Indians celebrate this victory, but their troubles are far from over. Religious tensions between Hindus and Muslims erupt into nation-wide violence. Gandhi declares a hunger strike, saying he will not eat until the fighting stops. The fighting does stop eventually, but the country is divided. It is decided that the northwest area of India, and eastern part of India (current day Bangladesh), both places where Muslims are in the majority, will become a new country called Pakistan (West and East Pakistan respectively). It is hoped that by encouraging the Muslims to live in a separate country, violence will abate. Gandhi is opposed to the idea, and is even willing to allow Muhammad Ali Jinnah to become the first prime minister of India, but the Partition of India is carried out nevertheless. Gandhi spends his last days trying to bring about peace between both nations. He thereby angers many dissidents on both sides, one of whom finally gets close enough to assassinate him.::gavin (gunmasterM@hotmail.com)", "movie_avg_rating": 4.02051282051282, "movie_year": 1982, "movie_title": "Gandhi", "movie_genres": ["Drama"], "movie_director": "Richard Attenborough", "movie_cast": ["Ben Kingsley", "Candice Bergen", "Edward Fox", "John Gielgud", "Trevor Howard", "John Mills", "Martin Sheen", "Ian Charleson", "Athol Fugard", "G\u00fcnther Maria Halmer", "Saeed Jaffrey", "Geraldine James", "Alyque Padamsee", "Amrish Puri", "Roshan Seth", "Rohini Hattangadi", "Ian Bannen", "Michael Bryant", "John Clements", "Richard Griffiths", "Nigel Hawthorne", "Bernard Hepton", "Michael Hordern", "Shreeram Lagoo", "Om Puri", "Virendra Razdan", "Richard Vernon", "Harsh Nayyar", "Prabhakar Patankar", "Vijay Kashyap", "Nigam Prakash", "Supriya Pathak", "Neena Gupta", "Shane Rimmer", "Peter Harlowe", "Anang Desai", "Winston Ntshona", "Peter Cartwright", "Marius Weyers", "Richard Mayes", "Alok Nath", "Dean Gasper", "Ken Hutchison", "Norman Chancer", "Gulshan Kapoor", "Charu Bala Chokshi", "Raj Chaturvedi", "Avpar Jhita", "Anthony Sagger", "David Gant", "Daniel Day-Lewis", "Ray Burdis", "Daniel Peacock", "Avis Bunnage", "Caroline Hutchison", "Mohan Agashe", "Sudhanshu Mishra", "Dina Nath", "John Savident", "John Patrick", "Michael Godley", "Stewart Harwood", "Stanley McGeagh", "Christopher Good", "David Markham", "Jyoti Sarup", "John Naylor", "Wilson George", "Hansu Mehta", "Sudarshan Sethi", "Sunila Pradhan", "Moti Makan", "Jalal Agha", "Rupert Frazer", "Manohar Pitale", "Homi Daruvala", "K.K.

They grew up in Hell's Kitchen, a far from perfect neighborhood, one filled as Shakes says with scams and shake downs, but one where the rules were known by its residents. The one adult who they admired was Father Bobby Carelli, who understood them as kids more than most adults and more than he himself would like to admit. In 1967, their lives would change forever when a typical teenage prank went wrong which led to the four of them being sentenced to various terms at Wilkinson Home for Boys, a reformatory. There, they were physically, emotionally and sexually abused primarily by Sean Nokes, the head guard of their cell block, and fellow guards Ralph Ferguson, Henry Addison, and Adam Styler, although there were other caring figures of authority at the home including other guards. Their time at the home affected the four, not all who were able to emerge from the experience to regroup their lives. In their want to forget about the experience, they made a vow not to talk about it either between themselves or with others. Fast forward thirteen years, with Tommy and Johnny being career criminals, Michael an assistant district attorney and Shakes a newspaper writer, their friendship on the surface more loose than it was when they were children. When Tommy and John spot Nokes, it leads to Shakes and Michael banding together to exact revenge not only on Nokes but all four of the guards who abused them. Michael had long mapped out a plan even before Tommy and John saw Nokes, but that sighting and its aftermath alters the plan. Beyond the precarious position Tommy and John place themselves into, Michael has the most to lose even if the plan succeeds. Most of the plan implementation is left to Shakes who has to enlist the machine of Hell's Kitchen, including mob boss King Benny, and their childhood friend, social worker Carol Martinez, who currently is John's girlfriend. Beyond co-opting aging lawyer Danny Snyder, who admits he may not be the best choice as an alcoholic who is no longer near the top of his game, the plan is threatened by a key piece, the need for an unreproachable figure to perjure him or herself, that person who Michael and Shakes hopes will be Father Bobby. Father Bobby, even if he knew of the abuse, may not be able to do his friends this enormous favor of an illegal nature, he who has to balance the morality of the situation in his own mind in deciding what to do.::Huggo", "movie_avg_rating": 3.514792899408284, "movie_year": 1996, "movie_title": "Sleepers", "movie_genres": ["Crime", "Drama"], "movie_director": "Barry Levinson", "movie_cast": ["Kevin Bacon", "Billy Crudup", "Robert De Niro", "Ron Eldard", "Minnie Driver", "Vittorio Gassman", "Dustin Hoffman", "Terry Kinney", "Bruno Kirby", "Frank Medrano", "Jason Patric", "Joe Perrino", "Brad Pitt", "Brad Renfro", "Geoffrey Wigdor", "Jonathan Tucker", "Peter Appel", "Joseph Attanasio", "Gerry Becker", "Casandra Brooks", "William K.

She doesn't even have enough money for the basics of food and shelter. Gay cabaret singer Carole 'Toddy' Todd may befall the same fate as Victoria as he was just fired from his singing gig at a second rate club named Chez Lui. To solve both their problems, Toddy comes up with what he considers an inspired idea: with Toddy as her manager, Victoria, pretending to be a man, get a job singing as a female impersonator. If they pull this scheme off, Toddy vows Victoria, as her male alter ego, will be the toast of Paris and as such be extremely wealthy. That alter ego they decide is Polish Count Victor Grazinski, Toddy's ex-lover who was disowned by his family when they found out he was gay. The Count auditions for the city's leading agent, Andre Cassell, who, impressed, gets him a gig performing in the city's best nightclub. In the audience on the successful opening night is Chicago nightclub owner and \"businessman\" King Marchand, a stereotypical macho male who falls in the love with the woman he sees on stage, which doesn't sit well with his current girlfriend, Norma Cassady. King is shocked to learn that that woman is a man named Count Grazinski. While King tries to reconcile his romantic feelings for \"Victoria\" (in truth, King doesn't truly believe the Count is a man), his business associates won't tolerate his change in sexual orientation. Although feeling emancipated being treated as a man, Victoria, as herself, in turn falls in love with King. To pursue something with him as a woman would mean giving up this lucrative career. But the career may also come to an end in a jail term if the authorities find out that Victoria and Toddy have committed fraud in this impersonation.::Huggo", "movie_avg_rating": 3.3376623376623376, "movie_year": 1982, "movie_title": "Victor/Victoria", "movie_genres": ["Comedy", "Musical"], "movie_director": "Blake Edwards", "movie_cast": ["Julie Andrews", "James Garner", "Robert Preston", "Lesley Ann Warren", "Alex Karras", "John Rhys-Davies", "Graham Stark", "Peter Arne", "Herb Tanney", "Michael Robbins", "Norman Chancer", "David Gant", "Maria Charles", "Malcolm Jamieson", "John Cassady", "Mike Tezcan", "Christopher Good", "Matyelok Gibbs", "Jay Benedict", "Olivier Pierre", "Martin Rayner", "George Silver", "Joanna Dickens", "Terence Skelton", "Ina Skriver", "Stuart Turton", "Geoffrey Beevers", "Sam Williams", "Simon Chandler", "Neil Cunningham", "Vivienne Chandler", "Bill Monks", "Perry Davey", "Elizabeth Vaughan", "Paddy Ward", "Tim Stern", "Norman Alden", "George Lane Cooper", "Peter Diamond", "Geoffrey Edwards", "Kevin Field", "Terri Gardener", "Philip Herbert", "Derek Lyons", "Chrissy Monk", "Ralph Morse", "Cathy Munroe", "Glen Murphy", "Nosher Powell", "Peter Ross-Murray", "Paddy Stone"]}, {"movie_plot": "Professional daredevil and white-suited hero, The Great Leslie, convinces turn-of-the-century auto makers that a race from New York to Paris (westward across America, the Bering Straight and Russia) will help to promote automobile sales.

Then, their stories diverged. Adams claimed that he left for his motel, where he was staying with his brother, and went to sleep. Harris, however, said that they were stopped by police late that night, and Adams suddenly shot the officer approaching their car. The film shows the audience the evidence gathered by the police, who were under extreme pressure to clear the case. It strongly makes a point that the circumstantial evidence was very flimsy. In fact, it becomes apparent that Harris was a much more likely suspect and was in the middle of a crime spree, eventually ending up on Death Row himself for the later commission of other crimes. Morris implies that the DA's and the judge's desire for the death penalty in this case (for which Harris would have been ineligible because of his youth) made Adams a scapegoat on whom to pin this heinous crime.::Tad Dibbern ", "movie_avg_rating": 3.7714285714285714, "movie_year": 1988, "movie_title": "Thin Blue Line, The", "movie_genres": ["Documentary"], "movie_director": "Errol Morris", "movie_cast": ["Randall Adams", "David Harris", "Gus Rose", "Jackie Johnson", "Marshall Touchton", "Dale Holt", "Sam Kittrell", "Hootie Nelson", "Dennis Johnson", "Floyd Jackson", "Edith James", "Dennis White", "Don Metcalfe", "Emily Miller", "R.L.

Although they are unable to meet all his demands including not being able to guarantee his release and return back to Ireland after all is said and done, Declan agrees to help them on the promise that they will do their best to meet that request. What happens is largely a function of Declan's relationship with his two handlers, the MVD's Major Valentina Koslova and FBI Deputy Director Carter Preston, the latter in particular who does not fully trust Declan. It is also affected by the nature of the history between Declan, Isabella and the Jackal.

Regina further learns from Hamilton Bartholomew of the CIA that they were after him, Charles Lampert only the primary alias he has been using of late. During WWII, Charles, a member of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), absconded with $250,000 worth of their gold bars that were destined for the French Resistance. The US government wants that money back. Charles had a few partners in crime among the OSS, namely four men: Tex Panthollow, Leopold Gideon, Herman Scobie and Carson Dyle. Besides Dyle who died in the war, Regina knows the other three men are still alive, as she recognized them from a photograph as the three unknown men who attended Charles' funeral. They are now after her as they also want the money which they believe she has, and will kill to get it. She knows nothing about the money, but realizes that it is her duty to find it to return it to its rightful owner, namely the US government, and that it may save her life from Charles' partners. Clues to the money's whereabouts may be among those possessions Charles had on the train. Coming to Regina's aid is Peter Joshua, a man she met while she was in Meg\u00e8ve. As Peter helps her, she quickly falls in love with him, and he seemingly with her.

Eighteen years after the series last aired, it lives on in the hearts of its rabid fans. However, it lives on in infamy for its stars, who have not been able to find meaningful acting work since. Their current lives revolve around cashing in on however those roles will afford, which usually entails attending fan conventions or worse, such as electronic store openings. Only Jason seems to relish his lot in life, until he finds out that his co-stars detest him because of his superior attitude as \"the Commander\", and much of the public considers him a laughing stock. Their lives change when Jason is approached by who he thinks are convention fans asking for help. They are in reality an alien race called Thermians, led by Mathesar, who have modeled their existence after the series, which they believe to be real. When Jason and then the rest of his co-stars (along with Guy Fleegman, who was killed off before the opening credits in only one episode) go along with the Thermians, Jason's co-stars who believe they are off to yet another paying gig, they learn that they have to portray their roles for real. Without screenwriters to get them to a happy and heroic ending, they have to trust that their play acting will work, especially in dealing with the Thermians' nemesis, General Sarris. Guy in particular fears that he will go the way his character did on the series. But when they run across technical issues that they as actors didn't care anything about during the filming of the series and thus now don't know how to deal with, they need to find someone who should know what to do.::Huggo", "movie_avg_rating": 2.5185185185185186, "movie_year": 1996, "movie_title": "Quest, The", "movie_genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "movie_director": "Dean Parisot", "movie_cast": ["Tim Allen", "Sigourney Weaver", "Alan Rickman", "Tony Shalhoub", "Sam Rockwell", "Daryl Mitchell", "Enrico Colantoni", "Robin Sachs", "Patrick Breen", "Missi Pyle", "Jed Rees", "Justin Long", "Jeremy Howard", "Kaitlin Cullum", "Jonathan Feyer", "Corbin Bleu", "Wayne P\u00e9re", "Sam Lloyd", "Bill Chott", "Morgan Rusler", "Gregg Binkley", "Brandon de Paul", "Paul G.

In the midst of a wild thunderstorm he demands to know why he has been betrayed by the god he has believed in and honored his whole life.

While staying with his sister-in-law, Rachel, much to the chagrin of her shifty reporter husband, Harry, he systematically sets out to break each commandment one by one. A natural at breaking commandments, Harry is drawn to Seth's mission in the hopes of using it to further his career, but ultimately they clash as Seth turns the table and uses Harry to fulfill some of his missions. Things get further complicated when Rachel and Seth are romantically drawn to each other as he struggles with his crisis of faith and she struggles with a failing marriage.

Act 1 begins in November 1957, when 16-year-old Genevi\u00e8ve, who works in her widowed mother's umbrella shop called \"Les parapluies de Cherbourg\", and 20-year-old Guy, who works as a mechanic at a gas station, are madly in love and want to get married. They are reluctant to tell anyone not only of their want to get married, but of their relationship. Genevi\u00e8ve believes her mother will think her too young and would want her to marry someone with better prospects, especially considering her own tenuous financial situation. And Guy is more concerned now about not abandoning his ailing godmother, Aunt \u00c9lise, who raised him, and who he looks after along with a young woman named Madeleine. Act 2, told largely from Genevi\u00e8ve's perspective, begins in February 1958. Guy, drafted to fight for the French in Algeria, has been gone for two months, and is expected to be gone for two years. Genevi\u00e8ve rarely hears from Guy. In order to solve their many problems, Genevi\u00e8ve's mother wants her to marry Roland Cassard, a refined, well-appointed diamond merchant who travels often for his work but is devoted to Genevi\u00e8ve whenever he is in Cherbourg. Genevi\u00e8ve still loves Guy but in her mind she's slowly losing him as a person. She must decide what to do about Roland, especially at accepting his proposal may become more difficult as time goes on. Act 3, told largely from Guy's perspective, begins in March 1959 upon his military discharge and return to Cherbourg. The war has changed him, and he must figure out the next phase of his life from his new perspective. Act 4 takes place on one snowy day in December 1963 and shows Genevi\u00e8ve and Guy in their current lives, based on what has happened in those previous three acts.::Huggo", "movie_avg_rating": 3.761904761904762, "movie_year": 1964, "movie_title": "Umbrellas of Cherbourg, The (Parapluies de Cherbourg, Les)", "movie_genres": ["Drama", "Musical"], "movie_director": "Jacques Demy", "movie_cast": ["Catherine Deneuve", "Nino Castelnuovo", "Anne Vernon", "Marc Michel", "Ellen Farner", "Mireille Perrey", "Jean Champion", "Pierre Caden", "Jean-Pierre Dorat", "Bernard Fradet", "Michel Benoist", "Philippe Dumat", "Doroth\u00e9e Blanck", "Jane Carat", "Harald Wolff", "Danielle Licari", "Jos\u00e9 Bartel", "Christiane Legrand", "Georges Blaness", "Claudine Meunier", "Claire Leclerc", "Patrick Bricard", "Jacques Camelinat", "Fran\u00e7ois Charet", "Jean-Pierre Chizat", "Jacques Demy", "Bernard Garnier", "Gis\u00e8le Grandpr\u00e9", "Herv\u00e9 Legrand", "Michel Legrand", "Myriam Michelson", "Paul Pavel", "Roger Perrinoz", "Rosalie Varda"]}, {"movie_plot": "Johnnie is a boxer.

Over time, people come to know him - he helps out a street magician, befriends an old man who keeps doves in his suitcase, and finds a mother, herself an outsider. That smile is always at hand.

An incident at the fair does spur one of her students, Daniel Webster, self-professed as not being good at most things but believing he is a good designer, to announce, with the support of his fellow students, that they want to build a solar powered car of his design as their project, and to enter that car in the upcoming Inter-island Race. American Corporate giant, CelTech, has agreed to sponsor the winner of that race for the grueling six day, 2,800km long Trans-Australian World Solar Challenge, at which the best minds in this field - corporate and academic - will be participating. CelTech expects their own financially supported entry to win the Hawaii race. Despite the odds against them, Ms. Beecher agrees, and is eventually able to convince, albeit reluctantly, the school's shop teacher, Frank Machi, to be another school supervisor on the project. The students, Sandra and Frank have to overcome many obstacles to even getting a finished product to enter the race, from self-doubt, to internal issues which may raise irreconcilable differences between the team members, to mostly everyone external to them believing they cannot achieve their goal. Their largest naysayers are their competitors, including CelTech, and current world champion, Hans Kooiman of the Euro Team, who have an elitist view of their world.::Huggo", "movie_avg_rating": 2.8, "movie_year": 1996, "movie_title": "Race the Sun", "movie_genres": ["Drama"], "movie_director": "Charles T.

Elizabeth and Jens had met in a university program for high achieving students. She was a product of European boarding schools, he was the son of a diplomat. After being arrested in London, England, for passing bad checks in 1986, they were both extradited to the United States and have now spent over 30 years behind bars. This beautifully crafted film reveals a mismanaged, or perhaps completely corrupted, judicial process. This was the first criminal trial held in front of TV cameras - the first high-profile, international case tried in a small town. Investigations over the past 3 years have turned up stunning evidence that was previously suppressed or deemed inadmissible. New forensic techniques have disproven evidence that was key to Soering's original conviction. Denied parole 12 times, his next hearing in 2017 may have a different outcome, at the same time the film is in release. Unidentified fingerprints, photographic evidence that points to sexual abuse, the presiding judge's friendship with the victims, a missing FBI profile, a bloody car with a knife under the seat - all point to a very different story, one that is revealed in the film.", "movie_avg_rating": 1.0, "movie_year": 1994, "movie_title": "Promise, The (Versprechen, Das)", "movie_genres": ["Romance"], "movie_director": "Karin Steinberger", "movie_cast": ["Imogen Poots", "Daniel Br\u00fchl", "Chuck Reid", "Ricky Gardner", "Elizabeth Haysom", "Jim Updike", "Jens S\u00f6ring", "Carlos Santos", "Dave Watson", "Gail Ball", "Ed Sulzbach", "Rich Zorn", "Larry King", "Robert Showalter", "Ken Englade", "Howard Haysom", "Richard Haysom", "Richard A.

Then they both plan to climb the 'Cerro Torre' in the Patagonia region of South America, near the Argentinian/Chilean border, one of the world's most difficult mountains, especially considering the extreme weather conditions in the area. The journalist Ivan, using the rivalry for media exploitation, is joining them and reporting. The rivalry among the two men results eventually in the death of a common friend. Martin claims to have been at the top of 'Cerro Torre', but can't proof it. Then Martin 'steals' Roccia's girlfriend (Katrina), who feels lonely and under appreciated by Roccia. After some time the two men meet again at 'Cerro Torre' and the rivalry results in a 'climb against time' in which Martin and Roccia each attempt different routes up the mountain in a race to the summit.
